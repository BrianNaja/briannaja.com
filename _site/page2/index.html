					<p>Collective bargaining is the process in which employees (through their unions) negotiate with their employers to determine their terms of employment. The terms that are usually negotiated include pay, retirement, health care, hours, leave and safety policies. At the end of this process, both parties walk away with a contract.</p>

<blockquote><p>Bottom line: The right to organize and collectively bargain is a fundamental American value; every American should have a voice on the job and a chance to negotiate for a fair day&rsquo;s pay after a hard day&rsquo;s work.</p></blockquote>

		      <p><time datetime="01 May 2013">01 May 2013</time></p>
					<p>The administration of a union takes time and money. Many unions have implemented contracts that require workers to become a union member and pay mandatory union dues. Right-To-Work laws make it illegal to impose these mandatory union dues. These laws where designed to undermine unions' bargaining strength and their primary focus is to make it harder for a workers' organization to sustain themselves financially.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Right-to-work laws cripple unions by saddling them with non-members who have no incentive to pay, but still enjoy the rights won by union efforts.</p></li>
<li><p>Right-to-work laws have no impact on boosting economic growth: research shows that there is no relationship between the right-to-work laws and state unemployment rates, state per capita income, or state job growth.</p></li>
<li><p>Right-to-work laws have no significant impact on an attracting employers to a particular state. Surveys of employers show that &ldquo;right to work&rdquo; is a minor or non-existent factor in location decisions and that higher-wage, hi-tech firms in particular generally prefer free-bargaining states.</p></li>
<li><p>Right-to-work laws lower wages - for both union and nonunion workers alike - by an average of $1,500 per year after accounting for the cost of living in each state.</p></li>
<li><p>Right-to-work laws also decrease the likelihood that employees get either health insurance or pensions through their jobs, for both union and nonunion workers.</p></li>
<li><p>By cutting wages, right-to-work laws threaten to undermine job growth by reducing the discretionary income people have to spend in the local retail, real estate, construction, and service industries. Every $1 million in wage cuts translates into an additional six jobs lost in the economy.</p></li>
</ul>


<blockquote><p>Right-To-Work is a clever name, but it&rsquo;s misleading once you look under the hood.</p></blockquote>
