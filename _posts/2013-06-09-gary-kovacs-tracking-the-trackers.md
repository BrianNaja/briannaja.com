Gary Kovacs is the CEO of [Mozilla Corporation](http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/ "Mozilla") the people who made Firefox.

Collusion is an experimental add-on for Firefox and allows you to see all the third parties that are tracking your movements across the Web. It will show, in real time, how that data creates a spider-web of interaction between companies and other trackers.
