title: Right To Work - A Closer Look

The administration of a union takes time and money. Many unions have implemented contracts that require workers to become a union member and pay mandatory union dues. Right-To-Work laws make it illegal to impose these mandatory union dues. These laws where designed to undermine unions' bargaining strength and their primary focus is to make it harder for a workers' organization to sustain themselves financially.

* Right-to-work laws cripple unions by saddling them with non-members who have no incentive to pay, but still enjoy the rights won by union efforts.

* Right-to-work laws have no impact on boosting economic growth: research shows that there is no relationship between the right-to-work laws and state unemployment rates, state per capita income, or state job growth.

* Right-to-work laws have no significant impact on an attracting employers to a particular state. Surveys of employers show that "right to work" is a minor or non-existent factor in location decisions and that higher-wage, hi-tech firms in particular generally prefer free-bargaining states.

* Right-to-work laws lower wages - for both union and nonunion workers alike - by an average of $1,500 per year after accounting for the cost of living in each state.

* Right-to-work laws also decrease the likelihood that employees get either health insurance or pensions through their jobs, for both union and nonunion workers.

* By cutting wages, right-to-work laws threaten to undermine job growth by reducing the discretionary income people have to spend in the local retail, real estate, construction, and service industries. Every $1 million in wage cuts translates into an additional six jobs lost in the economy.

>Right-To-Work is a clever name, but it's misleading once you look under the hood.
