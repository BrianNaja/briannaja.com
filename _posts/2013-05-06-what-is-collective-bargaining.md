Collective bargaining is the process in which employees (through their unions) negotiate with their employers to determine their terms of employment. The terms that are usually negotiated include pay, retirement, health care, hours, leave and safety policies. At the end of this process, both parties walk away with a contract.

>Bottom line: The right to organize and collectively bargain is a fundamental American value; every American should have a voice on the job and a chance to negotiate for a fair day's pay after a hard day's work.
