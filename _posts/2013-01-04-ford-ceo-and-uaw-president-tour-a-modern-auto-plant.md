Ford CEO Henry Ford II and United Automobile Workers president Walter Reuther are jointly touring a modern auto plant.

Ford jokingly jabs at Reuther: "Walter, how are you going to get these robots to pay UAW dues?"

Not missing a beat, Reuther responds: "Henry, how are you going to get them to buy your cars?"
