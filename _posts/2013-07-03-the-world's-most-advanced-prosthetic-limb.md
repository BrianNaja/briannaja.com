Nigel Ackland lost his right arm in an industrial accident about six years ago. Throughout months of surgeries, and with only an awkward hook to replace his hand, Ackland fell into a very dark emotional state. 

Early last year, his luck took quite a turn when he was asked to participate in a trial for the Bebionic3, a state-of-the-art prosthetic arm developed by [RSLSteeper](http://bebionic.com/the_hand/patient_stories/nigel_ackland).
