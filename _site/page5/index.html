					<p>Walmart is the largest private employer in the U.S. and has the most workers on public assistance.</p>

<p>In 2007, the company shifted from regular shifts to flexible shifts, a change labor activists said was designed to force full-time workers to downgrade their status to part-time, so they would not qualify for health insurance or other benefits.</p>

<p>The result is that hundreds of thousands of Walmart employees rely on state benefits or Medicaid. Most of the company&rsquo;s warehouses are contracted out to temp agencies, so even if a warehouse loader works full-time in a Walmart warehouse for years, he gets no benefits.</p>

<p>Wal-Mart&rsquo;s poverty wages force employees to rely on $2.66 billion in government help every year, or about $420,000 per store. In state after state, Wal-Mart employees are the top recipients of Medicaid. As many as 80 percent of workers in Wal-Mart stores use food stamps.</p>
